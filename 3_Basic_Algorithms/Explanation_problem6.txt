Problem 6.
Max and Min in a Unsorted Array
In this problem, we will look for smallest and largest integer from a list of unsorted integers. The code should run in O(n) time. Do not use Python's inbuilt functions to find min and max.

Bonus Challenge: Is it possible to find the max and min in a single traversal?

Methodology:
assign min and max values as first element from array
Then iterate thru array and compare each time min and max values, and replace if condition is met

Time complexity:
O(nlogn)
