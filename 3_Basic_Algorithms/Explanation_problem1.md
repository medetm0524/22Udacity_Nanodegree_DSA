Problem 1. 
Finding the Square Root of Integer 

Objective:
Find the square root of the integer without using any Python library. You have to find the floor value of the square root.

For example if the given number is 16, then the answer would be 4.

If the given number is 27, the answer would be 5 because sqrt(5) = 5.196 whose floor value is 5.

The expected time complexity is O(log(n))

Methodology
Used binary search technique to find a number of square root of target integer or closest one.

Time complexity
O(logn)

Space complexity
O(n)
