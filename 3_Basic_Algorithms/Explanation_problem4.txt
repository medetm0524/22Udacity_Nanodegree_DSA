Problem 4.

Dutch National Flag Problem
Given an input array consisting on only 0, 1, and 2, sort the array in a single traversal. You're not allowed to use any sorting function that Python provides.

Note: O(n) does not necessarily mean single-traversal. For e.g. if you traverse the array twice, that would still be an O(n) solution but it will not count as single traversal.

Methodology:
Use heap to sort the list

Time complexity - O(logn)
